            This is a personal project run by{" "}
            <a href="https://owg.me" class="text-accent hover:underline">the OneWheelGeek</a>. It is a
            self-hosted, multi-user gateway in front of your <strong class="text-text">Monica</strong> personal CRM,
            offered for personal use. It is <strong class="text-text">not a commercial product</strong>, there is no
            company behind it, and there is no support obligation.
          </p>

          <h2 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-text">What it stores</h2>
          <p>
            To talk to Monica on your behalf, this service stores the Monica instance URL and API token you provide.
            Tokens are encrypted at rest. The service also keeps your passkey credentials, a record of your API tokens,
            and an audit log of the MCP calls made through your account so you can see what happened. It does not show
            your contacts, identities, or credentials to other users — each account is isolated.
          </p>

          <h2 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-text">About your Monica token</h2>
          <p>
            I'll do my best to protect your Monica API token — it's encrypted and access is scoped to your account.
            But this is a hobby project, not a professionally operated, audited, or certified service.
            <strong class="text-text"> I make no legal guarantee that your credentials are safe.</strong>{" "}
            Accidents, bugs, outages, and breaches happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use this service at your own risk, and revoke the token in Monica the moment you stop using this service or
            suspect any problem. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this service is provided "as is", without
            warranty of any kind, and the operator accepts no liability for any loss or damage arising from its use.
          </p>

          <h2 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-text">Questions</h2>
          <p>
            Reach out to <a href="https://owg.me" class="text-accent hover:underline">the OneWheelGeek</a>. If any
            of this is unacceptable for your situation, please don't store a token here.
